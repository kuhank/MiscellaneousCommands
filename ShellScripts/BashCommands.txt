Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell

A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with an operating system. It acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system's kernel, allowing the user to execute commands, run programs, and manage files.


Key Features of a Shell:

Command Execution: Interpret and execute user commands (e.g., ls, cd, echo).
Scripting: Write and execute scripts for automating tasks.
Interaction: Act as an interactive interface between the user and the OS.
